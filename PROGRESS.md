# Progress

Source of truth for build state. "Done" means implemented **and** verified by
green CI (`main` branch).

## 2026-10-21 — P1-4 SQLite persistence

- Project files are ordinary SQLite databases with a relational schema
  (`project`, `project_holidays`, `calendars`, `calendar_holidays`,
  `wbs_nodes`, `activities`, `relationships`) versioned with
  `PRAGMA user_version` (D9).
- Saves validate dangling WBS/calendar/relationship references before
  writing, then replace the file contents in one transaction; a failed save
  leaves the previous file intact. Loads reject newer schema versions and
  malformed data with explicit errors.
- CLI now supports `cadence save <file>` and `cadence load <file>` on top of
  the demo; `LinkType::from_abbreviation` round-trips precedence types.
- CI green on `main` (run 39566216222, 58 tests).

## 2026-10-21 — Guide updated → process retro-fit + WBS & calendars

- Adopted the updated generic guide: discovery conversation completed with
  the human; created `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/scope.md`,
  `docs/inspiration.md`, `docs/assumptions-and-questions.md`, and all root
  tracking files; added `.opencode/agents/` definitions.
- Discovery answers recorded; multi-OS CI explicitly deferred (D5).
- P1-2 done: WBS tree (`wbs.rs`) with cycle-safe reparenting, delete guards,
  and undoable commands.
- P1-3 done: named calendars (`calendar_set.rs`), per-activity calendar
  selection, cross-calendar CPM convention (D6), undoable calendar commands.
  CI green on `main` (run 39559389569) after fixing cross-calendar
  working-day stepping with dedicated `advance`/`retreat` helpers.

## 2026-10-20 — Vertical slice complete

- Repo created (public: https://github.com/Perchemop/cadence), Phase 0
  scaffold + CI.
- P1-1 done: domain model, full CPM engine (FS/SS/FF/SF + lag, float,
  critical set, cycle detection), command layer with undo/redo, CLI demo
  printing the schedule table. 30+ unit tests. CI green after one clippy fix
  (needless lifetime in a test helper).

## Next slice

- P1-5: constraints (ASAP/ALAP, date constraints) in the engine, then P1-6
  property-based engine tests and the Phase-1 QC gate.
